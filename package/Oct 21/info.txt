1) The Opening Cutscene/Temple Cutscene is the first scene that we open with
2) The Sleeping Hart Cutscene is what occurs whenever Mariam gets back to the temple after the town. For this one, it actually happens after a cutscene in town. 

To have it working, you will need to set the sorting layer of the  "Temple Background" to the background layer.
The character layers for mariam, hart and alexa to the player/default layer. 
Then the canvas layer to the forground layer. 
When everything is set correctly, you will yield with a black screen. Hitting play then would make things show up in order
