Xenogears

I envision the battle system using a combo system akin to these two games, where pressing x, triangle, or circle in our game will do
a different kind of attack. As in Xenogears, executing the attacks in a certain order causes one to do a special attack that does
more damage than normal. 
We need a graphic to show both how many points each type of attack is but also how many action points (points available to be used) are
available to the player. The idea is that if the player gets 3 points each turn, using a command like charge will allow the player to
store up more points to be used at a single time. Alternative options would be to allow the player to defend or choose not to use all his
points in a single round. If the player stores up more points, the combo system will reward the player by giving bonus damage when
special combinations are used in a row. For example, if X and triangle produce a special combination, then by storing points and executing
this combo twice in a row will result in bonus damage. I think in the future having a combo tracker (the number of special combinations
used in one go) and a bonus damage tracker will add to the fun factor as the player tries to do more combinations. I think having three
possible combinations for now should suffice. For now, the point system would be 2 for a strong attack (triangle), 1 for two light 
attacks (X and circle). Adding elements or a flag to each basic attack could also influence why one type of attack is picked versus 
another, but for now the choice is tied to doing special combinations for bonus damage.
