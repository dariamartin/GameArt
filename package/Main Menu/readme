In order to use the main menu you need to go to "File" in the top left corner of unity and click on "Build Settings." Hereupon, you will
click the "Add Open Scenes" button and add all the currently open scenes that you have (you will need to open the scenes before they will
be considered available for addition). Put the main menu scene as "0" and the sample scene / town scene as "1." When you have both scenes
in the correct order, exit out of the build settings (you don't have to attemp to build the game) and start the game. If you click
on "Start," the screen should transition to the town.
